              These resources are designed so teachers can pick and remix them 
              to meet the needs of their classroom: use a short activity, 
              multiple units unit, or anything in between.

              These tools contextualize AI in multiple disciplines like art, 
              math, english, and history, so that teachers across the
              school can use them. We think all students and teachers should be
              able to access this skill!

              Between November 2022 and May 2023, we'll be working with ten
              teachers, representing nine disciplines, five states, and two
              countries to design these resourcesâ€”the goal is to center equity
              and incorpoate pedagogy from every discipline as much as possible.
