      <p>
        CRAFT resources are the product of iterative co-design between Stanford
        University students and personnel with practicing high school teachers
        from across the United States from multiple subject areas. The resource
        collection will continue to grow. To find out more information or if you
        are interested in getting involved, please{" "}
